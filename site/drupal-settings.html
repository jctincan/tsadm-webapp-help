<dd>To integrate a Drupal site with TSAdm tool you will have to add the following lines to the site's <code>settings.php</code> file:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">if (is_readable('/home/tsadm/drupal.settings.php'))
{
    $tsadm_referrer = __FILE__;
    # If this is a Drupal multisite installation and if it's NOT the
    # default site, we need to hardcode the site's name here, so
    # comment out the next line (remove the # character) if that's the case.
    #$tsadm_site_name = "{{site.name}}";
    require('/home/tsadm/drupal.settings.php');
}</pre>
<br />
That will tell Drupal which database to use, its user and password. Among other things.<br />
Note that because of the gitignore file, settings.php will be ignored, so you will have to force it using add -f /path/to/file/settings.php
